# Cybercore 2025

STORY:
This happens to be my first game project since I learned how to program so I could keep my promise of making a new kind of Armored Core spiritual successor for the mech community I've belonged to for ten years!

Thus, I came up with the idea for a "Spectacle Fighter Armored Core" style game featuring the cutting edge world of cyber spies. To realize this vision, I bought some tutorials covering Blender, Godot and FL Studio. Then after a decade of planning with a few months of coding this is the result!

To put it bluntly, all I did was take the inputs of Rising Thunder and apply them to the mechanics of Gundam Extreme Versus to see if it works for the PC. So just try out combos until you get bored, this is just a tech demo after all!

CONTROLS:
- W to move your AV forward
- A to strafe your AV left
- S to move your AV backward
- D to strafe your AV right
- Dash by tapping L x2 quickly
- J to use your spark attack
- K to use your melee attack
- L to use your boost
- U to activate your subweapon
- I to activate your special spark
- O to activate your special melee
- ; to search for targets
- Space to activate your extreme burst
- Step by tapping W/A/S/D x2 quickly
- Guard by tapping S then W quickly
- Transform by stepping while holding L
- Esc to quit the game
